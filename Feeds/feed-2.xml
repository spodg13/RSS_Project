<p>&#8220;We weren’t in L.A. in September, at all,” Christal Pace said.</p>
<p>We’ve been reporting on this problem with the Los Angeles Parking Violations Bureau for 15 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Christal says the plates for the red zone ticket match her minivan, but her van is silver, not white, as listed on the ticket.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>She paid the $186 ticket but wants a refund.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I paid the bill because I’m terrified,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want them to keep doubling it.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve paid two trips to Los Angeles investigating this issue. The parking bureau admitted that sometimes things like the letter &#8220;I&#8221; and the number &#8220;1&#8221; get transposed, but promised in 2009 to do better when people from Northern California claim they weren’t there.</p>
<p>In this case, they want Christal to show some proof she wasn’t in Los Angeles when the ticket was written. We’re helping her get that information to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>See a full statement from the Los Angles Parking Violations Bureau below:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our records indicate that the license plate and VIN number of the vehicle were confirmed when the citation was issued. This is considered <i>prima facie </i>evidence of a violation involving the vehicle in question. The DMV has informed us that no two vehicles have the same VIN or plate, regardless of the vehicle color, which is not a required field in citation issuance. Therefore, we cannot say the issuing officer made a mistake.</p>
<p>An initial notice of citation (Notice 1) was mailed in mid-October and the DMV confirmed there was no indication that the mail was undeliverable / sent back. The Parking Violations Bureau (PVB) received a phone call regarding this case approximately a week before the citation due date, and the motorist provided a copy of Notice 1 &#8211; therefore it&#8217;s assumed the notice was delivered in time.</p>
<p>A contest statement from the motorist was received past the due date for a citation review and they, therefore, forfeited their rights to a review and refund under the <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__leginfo.legislature.ca.gov_faces_codes-5FdisplaySection.xhtml-3FsectionNum-3D40215.-26lawCode-3DVEH&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=jGUuvAdBXp_VqQ6t0yah2g&amp;r=zvLQ3vGarDaWoFeWPaOxgv3groHYW-EuQb6De6fXs0w&amp;m=hyPRQQY4l05Yr9YeRW4epKMSMlc3TePhupcaSiNhk7ETctAtwqxGpBmyvWbdTLDz&amp;s=k_Qhetfj-RFvCo9rUAf4lqx70ymS6TlcKdilg65p7Ec&amp;e=">California Vehicle Code Section 40215(a)</a>, a state law.</p>
<p>If the motorist can provide evidence that the vehicle was not at the scene during the citation&#8217;s issuance, the case may be forwarded to Management to advise on a penalty dismissal.</p>
<p>As for the recurring issue, the PVB pulls their information directly from DMV records, so our accuracy is contingent upon motorists ensuring their DMV records are up to date.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On Tuesday, some spent close to an hour in line waiting for their test. It&#8217;s a necessary step for students to return to class and their families to return to work.</p>
<p>SCUSD leaders are up against the COVID-19 omicron variant. This past week, the district had 307 staff and 1,282 student unduplicated positive COVID cases, totaling 1,589 positive cases, according to a video address by SCUSD Superintendent Jorge Aguilar.</p>
<p>The district, like others, is facing a substitute teacher shortage.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="420" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In response, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an executive order Tuesday that would allow retired teachers and educators to step-in for districts with staff shortages due to COVID.</p>
<p><!--StartFragment --><span class="cf0">&#8220;We are doing our best to notify families as quickly as we can, but there is a high volume right now. That&#8217;s just one of the struggles as we manage this wave,&#8221; said Victoria Flores, director of Student Support and Health Services at SCUSD.</span></p>
<p>District leaders want to open more testing centers, but as of right now, do not have the staff to do so. That is one reason why lines at the Serna Center went down the block — families want to make sure they have answers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here because my daughter tested positive a few days ago, I am here to get her tested and get myself tested to get her back to school,&#8221; said Melvin Buford, a parent at Caleb Greenwood Elementary.</p>
<p><!--EndFragment --></p>
<p>Concerns for parents come at the same time as the positivity rate, last week, was 16%. School activities like lunch now bring more questions from parents as more is learned of how contagious the omicron variant can be.</p>
<p><!--StartFragment --></p>
<p><span class="cf0">&#8220;We&#8217;re focusing on those higher risk activities, like classrooms or sporting cohorts, other athletic cohorts. We do our best around lunchtime, we know that is a time when students would have masks off,&#8221; said Flores. </span></p>
<p><!--EndFragment --></p>
<p>A SCUSD spokesperson told CBS13 that the district ordered picnic tables, but they have not arrived due to supply chain issues. Yoga mats are also available for students at lunchtime.</p>
<p>As for tents for students to eat outside year-round, permits are required, according to a spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sites have tents that must be approved by the Division of State Architecture (DSA) for schools which is more challenging than simply purchasing and installing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Getting Answers: Paid COVID Sick Leave</h3>
<p>The governor&#8217;s budget, announced Monday, includes calls for new legislation to implement supplemental paid sick leave policies considering the current surge of COVID cases due to the omicron variant.</p>
<p>Existing sick leave policies are already in place, according to a spokesperson for the governor&#8217;s press office, that allow individuals to take time off to care for family members, including children.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation would be similar to the sick leave policy that expired last fall, which required businesses with 26 or more employees to offer as much as two weeks of supplemental paid sick leave to take care of themselves or family members.</p>
<p>Approximately 10.9 million at-home COVID-19 test kits arrived to school districts statewide, and SCUSD received their shipment from the statement before the end of 2021. By end-of-day Tuesday, all counties in California will have received the at-home kits they requested.</p>
<p>Those tests, according to a spokesperson for the Governor&#8217;s Office, are in addition to the 2 million tests provided to schools in early December prior to students leaving on winter break.</p>
<h3>Getting Answers: Distance Learning</h3>
<p>Only public health officials can decide if a school or school district closes. The waiver that allowed California schools to go to distance learning at the height of the pandemic expired in 2021.</p>
<p>SCUSD works closely with Sacramento County Public Health to establish best practices and health and safety protocols on campuses.</p>
<p>The Serna Center will be open for COVID testing on Monday January 17, a holiday, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. for SCUSD families and students. It will be staffed by volunteers.</p>

<p>Ahead of the surge, the governor wants to bring in additional medical workers to help alleviate the strain.</p>
<p>Hospitals are already packed with patients and experts say the peak is yet to come.</p>
<p>“The concern is we will have more patients than we have beds and staff to take care of,” said Dr. Aimee Sisson, the Yolo County public health officer.</p>
<p>Emergency departments are now seeing an influx of people. Mostly, hospitals say people are seeking COVID-19 tests or have mild symptoms of the virus.</p>
<p>At UC Davis Health, its emergency doors are flooded.</p>
<p>“What makes it hard is the waiting times,” said Dr. Sarah Medeiros, UC Davis Health. “So, sometimes we have people in the waiting room for hours and we have to triage people based on who is the sickest.”</p>
<p>The message from healthcare workers is unless it’s a serious case of COVID-19, don’t come.</p>
<p>Dr. Medeiros also says people have a good chance of catching the virus if they’re waiting for hours in the emergency department.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s data shows hospitalizations are rising while the availability of ICU beds is declining. The state saw a nearly seven percent increase of patients while there is 1,601 ICU beds available.</p>
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom recently said, “It’s going to put tremendous strain on our hospital system.”</p>
<p>He’s planning to bring in reinforcement by hiring more medical workers, but from where? The Governor’s Office told CBS13 it plans to contract traveling medical professionals but didn’t say how many.</p>
<p>The dire reality: there may be no cavalry to call. Unlike in 2020, states could send staff to regional surges but that may not be the case this time around with critical staff shortages being felt everywhere.</p>
<p>“I described this as essentially as a sports team and there is no second string sitting on the bench waiting to come in,” said Dr. Sisson.</p>
<p>As an <a href="https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2022/01/10/medical-worker-guidance-return-to-work-after-positive-test/">option</a>, the state is allowing asymptomatic healthcare workers to go to work under certain conditions.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>STOCKTON (CBS13) — Two suspects were arrested after leading Stockton police on a chase after in a stolen car following an alleged residential robbery, authorities said Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to the Stockton Police Department, 36-year-old Steve Lozano and 34-year-old Karina Grace Gentry were booked into jail and face charges of residential robbery, auto theft and possession of stolen property.</p>
<p>Officers responded shortly before 10 a.m. to reports of a home robbery in progress along the 2400 block of Cornflower Street. Lozano and Gentry fled in the resident&#8217;s car and initiated a high-speed chase.</p>
<p>Stockton police said the chase had to be called off for safety reasons, but the vehicle was located a short while later abandoned in the area of East Washington Street. A drone was called in to assist with the search for the suspects. A K-9 officer helped detain one of them while the other suspect was arrested without incident.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TRACY (CBS13) — Investigators in Tracy are seeking the community&#8217;s help in locating the vehicle involved in hit-and-run collision last November that left an Oregon man dead.</p>
<p>According to the Tracy Police Department, the collision happened shortly after 2 a.m. on November 28 along Larch Road and west of Tracy Boulevard. The victim in the collision, identified as Cody Crawford, died on January 8 after spending some time in the ICU of a San Joaquin County hospital.</p>
<p>Crawford was found lying on the side of the roadway with major injuries to the head and legs. Tracy police said Crawford had multiple surgeries but never regained consciousness after the collision.</p>
<p>Investigators said witness reported a black Nissan SUV as the suspect vehicle with a white male adult with long brown hair and a beard as the driver. This man contacted the police department after seeing information about himself on social media and fully cooperated with authorities, Tracy police said. It was determined that man was only a witness who arrived at the scene after Crawford was hit.</p>
<p>Tracy police said the suspect vehicle is believed to be smaller and lower than an SUV and could potentially have front-end damage to the hood, bumper, headlights and windshield.</p>
<p>Crawford — who is survived by a teen son, brothers and sisters — had been visiting Tracy to see friends. Anyone with information on the collision is asked to contact the Tracy Police Department.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[A suspected ballistic missile launched by North Korea on Tuesday was more advanced than the missile Pyongyang tested last week, reaching a velocity of more than 10 times the speed of sound, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(AP/CNN) &#8212; A suspected ballistic missile launched by North Korea on Tuesday was more advanced than the missile Pyongyang tested last week, reaching a velocity of more than 10 times the speed of sound, South Korea&#8217;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s projectile was launched from Jangang province, near the North Korean border with China and landed in the ocean between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, its flight covering a distance of more than 700 kilometers (435 miles) and reaching a height of 60 kilometers (37 miles), the statement said.</p>
<p>North Korea said Wednesday that it successfully test-fired a hypersonic missile, according to North Korean state media, making it the third alleged test of such a weapon by the Kim Jong Un regime. Kim attended the launch, state media reported.</p>
<p>Assessment of the test by South Korean and United States intelligence was ongoing, but initial analysis showed Tuesday&#8217;s test, in which the projectile reached a speed of Mach 10 was of a more advanced weapon than the test North Korea conducted last Thursday, the South Korean Joint Chiefs said.</p>
<p>That test was also of what North Korean state media claimed was a hypersonic missile. However, many experts doubted this claim.</p>
<p>A hypersonic missile actually refers to the payload that a rocket carries aloft. In this case, that payload could be what is called a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV).</p>
<p>An HGV can theoretically fly as fast as 20 times the speed of sound and can be very maneuverable in flight, making it almost impossible to shoot down, according to experts.</p>
<p>But a South Korean government statement Tuesday said, &#8220;Our military has the ability to detect and intercept this projectile, and we are continuously strengthening our response system.&#8221;</p>
<p>South Korea &#8220;expressed a strong regret over the North&#8217;s launch, which took place at a time when political stability is very important.&#8221;</p>
<p>A statement from US Forces Korea said the test posed no threat to US or South Korean territory or military personnel, but &#8220;the missile launch highlights the destabilizing impact of (North Korea&#8217;s) illicit weapons program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, the launch corresponded with an order issued to ground some flights on the U.S. West Coast.</p>
<p>Air-traffic controllers in other West Coast areas similarly ordered aircraft down, according to recordings shared online. A San Francisco air traffic controller ordered flights to avoid its airspace and not take off or land around the time without explaining why, according to a recording by the website LiveATC.net.</p>
<p>“Things are changing really quick,” the air traffic controller said in the recording, adding later: “I just heard something about ground-stopping all aircraft, so I don’t know anything, just hold tight there.”</p>
<p>North Korea has not released any information about Tuesday&#8217;s launch. Last week, North Korean state media gave details 24 hours after the test.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s test covered about the same distance at last week&#8217;s, 700 kilometers (435 miles), and the missile fell into the sea outside of Japan&#8217;s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), according to Japan&#8217;s Defense Ministry.</p>
<p>Pyongyang is barred from testing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons under international law.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[The meat was sold at several stores, including Walmart and WinCo]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CLACKAMAS, Ore. (AP) — A meat distributor based in Clackamas, Oregon, has recalled more than 28,300 pounds (12,800 kilograms) of ground beef because of concerns the meat may be contaminated with E. coli bacteria.</p>
<p>The raw ground beef products from Interstate Meat Distributors, Inc., were produced on Dec. 20, 2021, and shipped to Oregon, California, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.</p>
<p>The recalled products have establishment number “EST. 965” inside the USDA mark of inspection or printed next to the time stamp and use or freeze by date. They were sold at grocery stores including WinCo, Walmart, Kroger and Albertsons.</p>

<p>Anyone who has purchased the recalled products is urged to throw them away or return them to the place of purchase.</p>
<p>E. coli can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days after exposure, officials said. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.</p>
<p>While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is most common in children under 5. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output.</p>
<p>Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Kyle Shanahan was a teenager watching on the sideline when the heated playoff rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers reached a fever pitch with three straight NFC title game matchups.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SANTA CLARA (AP) &#8211; Kyle Shanahan was a teenager watching on the sideline when the heated playoff rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers reached a fever pitch with three straight NFC title game matchups.</p>
<p>Now Shanahan will take a starring role when one of the NFL&#8217;s great rivalries resumes as head coach of the 49ers instead of son of their offensive coordinator when San Francisco visits Dallas on Sunday in a wild-card matchup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s as cool as it gets because that&#8217;s the coolest part of my childhood growing up I feel like,&#8221; Shanahan said. &#8220;It was seventh grade, eighth grade, ninth grade, &#8217;92, &#8217;93, &#8217;94, every single year. I thought we were the best team in the league. &#8230; I remember being on that sideline and just watching how good the Cowboys were and it was unbelievable. And the next year, going to Dallas for the home-field advantage. And we all know what happened there, that one wasn&#8217;t even close.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shanahan then went into a deep dive on the meeting the next season that San Francisco won as if the game happened last week instead of more than a quarter-century ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you can tell, those games I still remember them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those are part of my childhood, that was such cool football because everyone knew that for those three NFC championships, those three years were the Super Bowl.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 49ers-Cowboys playoff history is a rich one from back-to-back conference title games in the early 1970s, the iconic &#8220;Catch&#8221; in the 1981 season and then the heated rivalry in the 1990s when the Cowboys won the first two meetings on the way to Super Bowl titles and then the Niners took the third game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy, were the games close,&#8221; Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said on his radio show. &#8220;It was just nip and tuck all the way, and it was a play here, a play there, and that&#8217;s the playoffs. These things are just razor thin as to how you can end up advancing in these playoffs. In those years, it made a lot of difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>This will be the eighth time these franchises have met in the postseason, tied for the second most of any matchup in the Super Bowl era to the nine games between the Rams and Cowboys.</p>
<p>But with six of the previous matchups coming in the conference title game, few rivalries have had as many big games or star players such as Roger Staubach, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Emmitt Smith, Deion Sanders, Steve Young, Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m damn fired up, man,&#8221; Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said. &#8220;Are you kidding me? The early 90s Dallas-Niners, some of the championship games, for me, coming up and watching those ones, I can hear (John) Madden and (Pat) Summerall talking it through. My first Dallas and Niner playoff game, I&#8217;m pretty fired up to do it man. It&#8217;s exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time coming as this will be the first playoff matchup since the 1994 season when the Niners beat the Cowboys in the NFC title game.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the first time since 1998 that both teams are in the playoffs in the same season, meaning the current players don&#8217;t have the same nostalgia to the rivalry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; Shanahan said. &#8220;I wish I could say yes, but some of these players were born in the 2000s. So you like to think so, but every day in the quarterback room, when I ask certain questions like, &#8216;Have you seen Wedding Crashers?&#8217; And they don&#8217;t even know that sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the history of the playoff rivalry.</p>
<p>AMERICA&#8217;S TEAM</p>
<p>The teams squared off in the first three years after the merger with the Cowboys beating the Niners for the NFC title game in 1970 and &#8217;71 and again the next year to help launch their status as &#8220;America&#8217;s Team.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the first meeting at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco, Dallas used 143 yards rushing and a TD from Duane Thomas and two interceptions of John Brodie to win 17-10.</p>
<p>Dallas&#8217; defense dominated again the next year with three more interceptions of Brodie in a 14-3 win that led the Cowboys to their first Super Bowl title.</p>
<p>The next meeting in the divisional round at Candlestick Park helped Staubach earn the moniker of &#8220;Captain Comeback.&#8221;</p>
<p>Staubach entered the game in the fourth quarter with Dallas down 28-13 and led the team on three scoring drives. He threw a 20-yard TD pass to Billy Parks with 1:20 left to cut the deficit to 28-23. After a successful onside kick, the Cowboys won it on a 10-yard TD pass from Staubach to Ron Sellers with 52 seconds to play.</p>
<p>THE CATCH</p>
<p>The Niners fell off after that three-year run, but got their revenge with a late-game comeback of their own to launch a dynasty in the 1981 NFC championship game.</p>
<p>San Francisco took over at its 11 with 4:54 to play trailing 27-21 when Montana took over. He picked apart Dallas&#8217; Doomsday Defense with a quintessential West Coast offense drive.</p>
<p>Then the Niners faced a third-and-4 at the Dallas 6 with less than a minute to play when Bill Walsh called &#8220;Spring Right Option.&#8221; Montana rolled right and couldn&#8217;t find an open receiver immediately. Then with Ed &#8220;Too Tall&#8221; Jones and the Dallas defense closing in, Montana launched a high pass that seemed headed out of the end zone.</p>
<p>But Dwight Clark leaped over Everson Walls in the back of the end zone and came down with &#8220;The Catch&#8221; to give San Francisco a 28-27 lead.</p>
<p>The win was sealed when Danny White lost a fumble and San Francisco won its first of five Super Bowl titles in a 14-year span two weeks later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Start of a dynasty,&#8221; former 49ers president Carmen Policy said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t let myself go down the road of what would have happened if he doesn&#8217;t make that catch.&#8221;</p>
<p>HOW &#8216;BOUT THEM COWBOYS</p>
<p>While the Niners dynasty was launched with that win, it was the start of Dallas&#8217; demise under coach Tom Landry. The Cowboys bottomed out with a one-win season in Jimmy Johnson&#8217;s first season in 1989 before beginning a steady rise.</p>
<p>That helped lead to the Cowboys making it to the 1992 NFC title game in San Francisco against a stacked Niners team led by Steve Young and Jerry Rice.</p>
<p>But the young Cowboys didn&#8217;t flinch, getting two TDs from Smith to build a 23-20 lead and then Aikman helped seal it with a 70-yard pass to Alvin Harper to set up another TD.</p>
<p>The rematch the next season wasn&#8217;t nearly as tight with the Cowboys building a 28-7 halftime lead on the way to a 38-21 win after Johnson guaranteed victory earlier in the week. Johnson punctuated both wins with his &#8220;How &#8217;bout them Cowboys!&#8221; proclamation in the victorious locker room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been talking all week,&#8221; Johnson told his team. &#8220;If you&#8217;re gonna talk the talk, you gotta walk the walk. Thanks to you guys, y&#8217;all did the walkin.&#8221;</p>
<p>YOUNG&#8217;S BREAKTHROUGH</p>
<p>After those two losses raised questions if Young would ever win the &#8220;big one,&#8221; the game the next year helped establish him as one of the greats.</p>
<p>Eric Davis got it started with a pick-6 on the opening possession. Two more turnovers helped San Francisco break out to a 21-0 lead less than five minutes into the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spotting them a 21-point lead was like spotting Carl Lewis 20 yards in a 100-yard dash,&#8221; Smith said.</p>
<p>Young did the rest with two TD passes and a TD run and went on to win Super Bowl MVP two weeks later.</p>
<p>&#8220;To answer that pressure is one of the great feelings in sports,&#8221; he said after that win over Dallas.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BARSTOW (AP) — Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered state Capitol flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of a Southern California firefighter who died more than a month after being struck by a vehicle at an accident scene.</p>
<p>Barstow Fire Protection District Engineer David Spink, 56, died on Jan. 9 from injuries suffered Dec. 5 when he was struck while providing care for victims of a traffic collision on Interstate 15 in Barstow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Engineer Spink’s legacy lives on in the community he served for over three decades and through his son Dallen, who has followed in his footsteps at the Barstow Fire Protection District,” the governor said in a statement.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SONORA (CBS13) — A motorcycle rider has died after a crash while trying to get onto Highway 108 in Sonora on Monday. </p>
<p>California Highway Patrol says, a little after 4:30 p.m., a 66-year-old Tuolumne man was on Mono Way and trying to get onto SR-108 from a designated left-turn lane. An SUV was also heading eastbound on the highway at the same time. </p>
<p>Both the SUV and motorcycle then entered the intersection at the same time, causing the two vehicles to collide. </p>
<p>Officers say one of the vehicles didn’t stop for the red light, but it’s unclear if it was the SUV or the motorcycle. </p>
<p>The motorcyclist suffered serious injuries in the crash and was rushed to the hospital, but he was later pronounced dead. The SUV driver suffered minor injuries, CHP says. </p>
<p>Authorities have not yet released the name of the motorcycle rider. </p>

<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom’s budget proposal, which he unveiled on Monday, projects a massive $45.7 billion surplus for the year. The state is obligated to give about $2.6 billion back to the taxpayers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s undecided whether that will be given out as a stimulus check, like the Golden State Stimulus last year, however. But, Gov. Newsom says he’s working on it with the legislature.</p>
<p>Some Californians are still waiting on the last round of Golden State Stimulus checks.</p>

He was booked at a La Huacana nightclub when he and two of his crew members were assaulted and robbed just moments before his performance.</p>
<p>The singer took to social media, explaining his story to nearly half a million followers that he was struck with a pistol. Showing his wounds to the camera.</p>
<p>The Tracy Police Department confirmed to CBS13 that not only were band members and Mendoza hit in the head with pistols, but everything they needed for the stage was stolen.</p>
<p>“The two suspects assaulted the victims, stole the vehicle which also had their cellphones and band equipment inside,&#8221; said&nbsp;Sgt. Craig Kootstra with Tracy police.</p>
<p>Koostra explained that the suspect took off in the singer&#8217;s van toward the Bay Area before an officer spotted the stolen vehicle.</p>
<p>“He followed the vehicle on [westbound 205], waited for more officers to get behind him. CHP Dublin did use spike strips to stop the vehicle,&#8221; Koostra said.</p>
<p>Officers arrested the driver. Mendoza was able to get his gear back.</p>
<p>“He actually met with our officers. He was very grateful for the work that our officers conducted that night and how quickly he was able to get his equipment back,&#8221; Koostra said.</p>
<p>Tracy police has one suspect in custody and are still looking for the second person involved.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure all our businesses are safe spaces not only for our residents but for people coming to tracy to enjoy nightlife or going out to dinner with families,&#8221; Koostra said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Jarret Allen had 18 points and 17 rebounds, Darius Garland also had a double-double and the Cleveland Cavaliers held off the Sacramento Kings 109-108 on Monday night.</p>
<p>Kevin Love scored 19 points, Evan Mobley added 17 and Lauri Markkanen and Cedi Osman finished with 15 points apiece. Garland had 12 points and 11 assists as the Cavaliers completed the season sweep of the Kings.</p>
<p>As good as the win felt, Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff wasn’t entirely pleased. The Cavs committed 17 turnovers that led to 20 points, allowed 15 offensive rebounds and went scoreless over the final 2 ½ minutes.</p>
<p>“It’s a win so we’ll take it but it wasn’t our best,” Bickerstaff said. “We talk about playing with purpose and discipline for 48 minutes. We didn’t do that tonight. We can’t put ourselves in these type of positions. We have to improve because it’s going to cost us down the stretch if we don’t.”</p>
<p>Tyrese Haliburton had 21 points and eight assists for Sacramento. Buddy Hield added 19 points. The Kings have lost a season-worst five straight.</p>
<p>Cleveland led 109-99 with 2:34 remaining but went cold. Sacramento went on its biggest run after that and got within 109-108 on two free throws by De&#8217;Aaron Fox. After the Cavaliers turned the ball over, Fox missed a 15-footer as time expired.</p>
<p>“We did all we needed to do to put ourselves in a position to win, We just couldn’t quite get over the hump,” Kings interim coach Alvin Gentry said. “If you tell me that I could get De’Aaron Fox a foul-line jumpshot to win the game, I’ll take that. If we play that way night in and night out we’ll change the direction of our team.”</p>
<p>The Cavaliers led going into the fourth quarter, fell behind by three, then went on a 14-2 run to take a comfortable lead. Mobley, quiet for most of the evening, made a pair of baskets during the run then later made a three-point play to make it 106-99. Markkanen followed with a 3-pointer before the Kings made their late push.</p>
<p>“The message today was to come back how we were two weeks ago,” Allen said. “We were rebounding the ball, protecting the paint, doing everything that made us a good team. It was a huge step in the right direction.”</p>
<p>Coming off a season-low two points in Sunday’s 96-82 loss to Golden State on Sunday, Love got the Cavaliers going early and had 14 points in the first half including a 3-pointer that put Cleveland ahead by 12.</p>
<p>The Kings got within 47-45 on Marvin Bagley III’s dunk but Garland hit a 3-pointer atop the arc for the Cavs and Osman followed with a pair of free throws. Osman later scored on a reverse just before halftime to make it 62-49.</p>
<p>Lamar Stevens scored six of Cleveland’s first 11 points in the third quarter and fed Allen with an alley-oop pass but Hield made back-to-back 3s then added a third beyond the arc to help Sacramento get within 84-79.</p>
<p>TIP-INS</p>
<p>Cavaliers: Allen had his double-double before halftime.</p>
<p>Kings: Richaun Holmes and Damian Jones remain in the NBA health and safety protocol.</p>
<p>UP NEXT</p>
<p>Cavaliers: Continue their six-game road trip at Utah on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kings: Face the Lakers on Wednesday at Golden 1 Center.</p>
